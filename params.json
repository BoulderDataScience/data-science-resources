From learning the basics to hacking on projects and getting jobs, it's all here.\r\n\r\n### Machine Learning in Python\r\n- [scikit-learn documentation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/): description\r\n\r\n### Neural Networks / Deep Learning\r\n- [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html)\r\n- [Google / Udacity Deep Learning Course](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730)\r\n- [Deep Learning, NLP, and Representations](http://colah.github.io/posts/2014-07-NLP-RNNs-Representations/)\r\n\r\n### Data Visualization\r\n- [Setosa.io](http://setosa.io/)\r\n\r\n### Auto-ML\r\n- [The Automated Statistician](http://www.automaticstatistician.com/static/assets/auto-report-affairs.pdf)\r\n\r\n## Learning the Foundations\r\n- \r\n\r\n### Statistics\r\n- [Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/ISLR%20First%20Printing.pdf)\r\n- [Elements of Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/local.ftp/Springer/OLD/ESLII_print4.pdf)\r\n\r\n### Maths\r\n- [Singular Value Decomposition](https://www.metacademy.org/graphs/concepts/singular_value_decomposition)\r\n\r\n### Programming in Python\r\n- [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/)\r\n\r\n### GitHub\r\n- \r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Get in Touch\r\nGot a stellar resource to add to this list? Send us a message on the [BDS Meetup page](), or submit a pull request to the 'gh-pages' branch of [this resources repo]().",
